Developing a record-keeping web application for a retro-gaming event. In the event, 8–16 participants play games on-site on up to four Sega MegaDrive II gaming consoles.

An event lasts one day. Usually, three tournaments (games) are played per event. There are several game types, and according to the game type and number of participants, tournaments can have different stages.

Some tournaments have a group stage, with groups of 3–4 participants, where every contestant meets every other group participant. The best of them advance to the elimination rounds.

Other tournaments have elimination rounds only.

Some games, like Bomberman and Micro Machines, are played by four players simultaneously, while the majority of games are played by two players at a time.

Some other games include Mortal Kombat 3, Street Fighter II, Sensible Soccer, NBA Jam, R'n'R Racing, etc.

The web application consists of an ASP.NET Web API on the backend, an Angular client on the frontend, and a MS SQL database for persisting the data.

The application will be used to automate the tournament draw process, enter the results, and keep track of participants who advance to the next stage.
